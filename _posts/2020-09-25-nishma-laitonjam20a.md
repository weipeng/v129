title: Scalable Inference on the Soft Affiliation Graph Model for Overlapping Community
  Detection
crossref: acml20
abstract: The Soft Affiliation Graph model (S-AGM) is a Bayesian generative model
  of overlapping community structure in social networks. Inference on this model is
  challenging due to the complexity of both the underlying network structure and the
  presence of non-conjugacy in the model. Scalable MCMC on the model is possible through
  the use of Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics (SGRLD). In this paper,
  we develop a novel and scalable Stochastic Gradient Variational Inference (SG-VI)
  algorithm and compare it to SGRLD inference. Similarly to MCMC inference, handling
  non-conjugacy in the S-AGM is a significant challenge for developing an SG-VI and
  requires the application of stochastic Monte Carlo estimation. We carry out a thorough
  empirical comparison of the SG-VI and SGRLD approaches, and draw some general conclusions
  about scalable inference on the S-AGM.
